		<h2 id="#top">Cashew Queso</h2>
			<p>Ubiquitous in ballparks and <abbr title="Texan and Mexican Fusion Cuisine">Tex-Mex</abbr> restaurants everywhere is the glorious combination of hot, liquefied cheese and crispy tortilla chips. The quality (and moniker) of said dish varies wildly from venue to venue, but the cheese type product utilized hovers at a near constant level: industrially produced yellow gloop.</p>
			<p>Upgrade from the dismal experience of mysterious dairy products and say &lsquo;Right on!&rsquo; to the rich, creamy goodness of blended cashews seasoned to delicious perfection. Did we mention it's vegan <i>and</i> gluten-free?</p><hr /><hr />
			<h4>Ingredients</h4>
			<ul><li>.75 cup cashews, soaked for <em>at least</em> 2 hours
				(<a href="../cashew-101.html">Review Cashew Tips and Tricks</a>)</li>
				<li>1.25 cups vegetable broth</li>
				<li>1 Tb white miso paste</li>
				<li>3 Tb nutritional yeast flakes</li>
				<li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
				<li>2 tsp ground cumin</li>
				<li>.25 tsp salt</li>
				<li>2 TB fresh lemon juice</li>
				<br />
				<li>2 tsp olive oil</li>
				<li>1 small yellow onion, finely diced</li>
				<li>1 jalape&ntilde;o, seeded and chopped</li></ul>
				<h4>Process</h4>
				<ol><li>Drain cashews and add them to a blender along with the vegetable broth, miso, nutritional yeast, garlic, cumin, salt, and lemon juice. Puree until completely smooth, which may take several minutes depending on your blender (I recommend investing in a <a href="https://www.vitamix.com" target="_blank">Vitamix</a> for the most extreme blending pleasure).</li>
					<li>Preheat a 2-quart saucepan over low heat and add the oil. Saut&eacute; the onion and jalape&ntilde;o for 3 minutes, or until just soft.</li>
					<li>Add blended cashew mixture to saucepan and increase heat to medium.</li>
					<li>Cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until the queso is hot and thickened.</li>
					<li>Keep warm until ready to dig in!</li></ol>

					<p id="#outro">This recipe makes a wonderful companion to <a href="lentil-tacos.html">Lentil Tacos</a> and <a href="triple-bean-super-chili.html">Triple Bean Super Chili</a>, but we enjoy it best straight out of the saucepan with its humble companion, the tortilla chip. Our favorites are the <b>365 Everyday Value Restaurant Style</b> salted tortilla chips found at Whole Foods Market (<a href="http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/stores/list">Locate the Whole Foods Market nearest you</a>).</p>
